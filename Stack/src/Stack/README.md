A binary tree is a unique data structure used for data storage purposes.
A binary tree has a unique condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. 
A binary tree has the benefit of having both an ordered array and a LinkedList as search as quick as in a Sorted array, and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in a LinkedList.

Applications of BinaryTree:
Implementing routing table in a router.
Data compression code.
Its implementation of the expression parsers and expression solvers.
To solve database problem such as indexing.
Expression evaluation.
