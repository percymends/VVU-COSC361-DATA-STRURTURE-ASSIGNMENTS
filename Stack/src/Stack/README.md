A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last–In, First–Out) principle.
That means the objects can be inserted or removed only at one end of it, also called a top.

The stack supports the following operations:
Push inserts an item at the top of the stack (i.e., above its current top element).
Pop removes the object at the top of the stack and returns that object from the function. The stack size will be decremented by one.
isEmpty tests if the stack is empty or not.
isFull tests if the stack is full or not.
Peek returns the object at the top of the stack without removing it from the stack or modifying the stack in any way.
Size returns the total number of elements present in the stack.
